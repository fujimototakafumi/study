=====<Move Details>=====

 - Fatal Leg Twister, Cross Scissor Pressure and Earth Direct are unblockable throws
 - Axle Spin Knuckle goes through mid-level projectiles (Hadouken and such)
 - Fatal Leg Twister can only grab grounded opponents, but Cross Scissor Pressure can grab
both grounded and jumping opponents
 - Cannon Revenge High reverses high attacks and Low reverses low attacks
 - Sniping Heel will automatically attack high if you Super Cancel into it
 - You cannot perform Psycho Streak if there's already a Vega in the screen
 - At the start of Killer Bee Assault Cammy will hop to the wall instead of ceiling if the
opponent is too far up or if you selected the extra mode



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Miscellaneous Notes>=====

 - To change her size to TV aspect ratio (a.k.a. CvS scale), open the .def file and replace
   "Constants.cns" with "ConstantsCvS.cns";

 - Holding down a button as Cammy wins a round allows you to select her win pose;
